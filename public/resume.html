    <h2>Summary</h2>
    Hi there! My name is Lisa Nguyen. I am an aspiring web developer as well as UX/UI designer. <br />
    I've always loved expressing my creativity- whether it be by acting or painting. These past <br />
    few weeks I have been working on my front-end developing skills. I love desinging webpages <br />
    as well as apps, but I also love coding, which is why I decided to participate in a bootcamp <br />
    for front-end development to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as React. <br />
    I'm excited to continue to learn and to grow.

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <!--
    <h3>Promoter</h3>
    <h4>2019-2023</h4>
    I have been occasionally working as a promoter since 2019. During those years, I have had the honor of working on multiple different projects <br />
    with many brands (e.g. YFood, UNICEF). As a promoter, I represent the brand. Sometimes, I had to give out samples of the brand's product, <br />
    sometimes I had to approach people and educate them on certain topics - whatever it was exactly, I always had to approach strangers. In those <br />
    projects I quickly learned how to actively and kindly approach people, how to talk to them and how to please them. As I said, while working <br />
    for those brands, I am considered a representitive of the brand, meaning I have to ensure customer satisfaction in order to leave a good <br />
    impression of the brand.
    <h3>Extra</h3>
    <h4>2022-2023</h4>
    I have been regularly working as an extra in movies as well as series since 2022. I had the opportunity of working with many different film <br />
    crews and got to see a whole new world behind the glamorious acting facade. During my time as an extra I learned getting out of my comfort <br />
    zone, working professionally and how to be more confident.
    <h3>Waitress</h3>
    <h4>2016-2023</h4>
    Ever since I was 16, I have been working as a waitress at my parent's restaurant. I cleaned tablets and served customers (e.g. taking their <br />
    orders, bringing their food, ensuring they have the best experience at our restaurant). Working at a restaurant, I had to learn working under <br />
    stress, dealing with rude customers and being quick on my feet.
