<h1>The Best Movies According to Lisa</h1>
  <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
    <h3>High School Musical</h3>
    <p> Honestly, it's my all time favorite! I used to watch it as a kid and it has brought me many amazing memories!<br />
    Growing up, I've always wanted to be like Gabriella Montez, aka Vanessa Hudgens.

    <h3>Troy</h3>
    <p>
    I used to love this movie! Especially because of Brad Pitt who did an amazing job at portraying the character of Achilles.

    <h3>Pitch Perfect</h3>
    <p>Honestly, I have no idea what else I liked in the past, I'm not really a movie-person. That's why I just typed in the next best thing that popped into my mind.
