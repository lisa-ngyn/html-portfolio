    My name is Lisa Nguyen. I am currently a student, studying human-computer-interaction at the University of Hamburg.
    In my freetime, I like to go for walks, bake, sing and dance. I especially enjoy expressing my creativity. <br />
    The past few months I have been working on my <a href="https://lisanguyen.crevado.com">Portfolio</a> to improve my UX / UI skills.
    However, I also enjoy coding, which is what I am currently working on. <br />
    Thanks for joining me on my journey!
