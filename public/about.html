<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Lisa Nguyen. I am an aspiring web-developer and UX/UI designer. I'm exciting to learn, grow and expand my skills.</p>

<p>Outside of coding or designing websites as well as apps, I love going for walks, hanging out with my friends, baking, dancing and singing.</p>

<p>My dream in life is to help as many people as possible, live in a panthouse with my future husband as well as my future kids and without having to worry about anything.</p>
